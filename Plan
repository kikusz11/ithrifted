Update HeroStrip to Use Real Products
The user wants the "thin images" in the hero section (
HeroStrip
 component) to display real products from the shop instead of mock data.

Proposed Changes
HeroStrip.tsx
Imports:
Import supabase from ../lib/supabaseClient.
Import useNavigate from react-router-dom.
Cleanup:
Remove the mock supabase object and mockData.
Logic:
Use the real supabase client to fetch the latest 25 products.
Update 
handleProductClick
 to use navigate('/product/' + productId).
Update the "shop" button to navigate to /shop.
Verification Plan
Manual Verification (Local)
Check the hero section -> Should show images of real products from the database.
Click on a strip image -> Should navigate to that product's detail page.
Click on the "shop" button -> Should navigate to /shop.
